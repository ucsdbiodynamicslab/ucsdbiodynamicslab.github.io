## Mission

At its core, synthetic biology seeks to redesign living systems with purpose. By integrating genetic engineering, computation, and biochemical methods, researchers craft cells and cell free platforms that perform useful tasks for medicine, sustainability, and beyond. Progress depends on teams that speak many scientific languages and combine them into a shared framework for biological design. The Synthetic Biology Institute brings these communities together, uniting experts in biology, chemistry, engineering, the physical sciences, and computation to address problems that no single field can solve alone.
