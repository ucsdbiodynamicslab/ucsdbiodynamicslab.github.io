The UC San Diego Synthetic Biology Institute advances quantitative and design driven approaches to engineering living systems. Our work spans gene circuit design, microbial consortia, cell based computation and the development of technologies that bridge biology, engineering and the physical sciences. By integrating experimental biology with modeling and theory, SBI supports research that connects foundational science with real world applications in health, environment and biotechnology.

## Mission

SBI fosters a collaborative environment where engineers, biologists and computational scientists develop tools to understand and control biological systems. The institute focuses on:

- Quantitative and predictive approaches to gene regulation  
- Design of synthetic gene circuits and cellular behaviors  
- Engineering multicellular and ecological interactions  
- Building experimental platforms for dynamical systems biology  
- Training the next generation of synthetic biologists through hands-on research

## People

SBI includes core faculty leading research groups at UC San Diego, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students and research staff. Leadership, administrative contacts and the roster of affiliated labs are listed on the Members page.

## Research Themes

The institute organizes its work around several interconnected areas:

- Gene circuit engineering and dynamical behavior  
- Stochastic processes in living cells  
- Synthetic microbial ecosystems  
- Cell based computation and biosensing  
- Quantitative imaging and automated measurement  
- Computational modeling and theory  

Each theme links to ongoing projects, publications and opportunities for collaboration.

## Partnerships

SBI collaborates with groups across UC San Diego such as Bioengineering, QBio, the BioCircuits Institute, and the Center for Microbiome Innovation. These partnerships support interdisciplinary projects, shared facilities and joint training programs.

## Opportunities

Students and postdocs can learn more about joining SBI on the member labs' home pages. Information on workshops, seminars and community activities is maintained in the News and Events section.
